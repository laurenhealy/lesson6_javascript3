### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The BOM contains the document object (contents of the document in a browser). The Document object has its own model known as the DOM. 
2. Dynamic HTML or DHTML is a combination of HTML, CCS and Javascript that allows interaction that changes the contents of a web page without reloading.
3. Each item in the DOM hierarchy tree is a node. Most common are element, attribute and text content nodes.
